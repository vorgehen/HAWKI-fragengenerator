# Filesystem Storage
# ==================
#
# Uploaded media files are typically stored on disk and served from an asset web server.
# However, to simplify the setup the uploaded files will be served by PHP by default,
# though thos is not so good for performance. Alternateively Amazon S3 could be used.
#
# NOTE: If you want to serve media files with your web server, choose "public" for
# FILESYSTEM_DISK. In this case make the server serve the files from the "app/public"
# directory. The HTTP address must be your APP_URL followed by "/storage".

```
php artisan migrate:avatars
```


6- **Create Schedule Service**

If you are using an Apache Server create a new file in `/etc/systemd/system` for schedule worker and call it "schedule-worker.service". Insert this content:

>**Don't forget to update paths: `/var/www/html/hawki-project`**

```
[Unit]
Description=Laravel Scheduler
After=network.target

[Service]
User=www-data
Group=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/var/www/html/hawki-project
ExecStart=/usr/bin/php /var/www/html/hawki-project/artisan schedule:work
Restart=always
TimeoutSec=300
LimitNOFILE=4096

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```


Reload Systemd Manager Configuration

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Enable services:

```
sudo systemctl enable schedule-worker.service
```

Start the Services:

```
sudo systemctl start schedule-worker.service
```

Check Status (to ensure it has started correctly):

```
sudo systemctl status schedule-worker.service
```

By default model status update runs every 15 minutes.
In order to check the models statuses run:
```
php artisan check:model-status
```

7- Finally clear the cache by running:

```
php hawki clear-cache

At this point, the new version should be ready and running on your machine.
