# HAWKI - fragen-playground

## About

fragen-playground is a branch of HAWKI to propose two solution strategies for feature "upload private files und generate question about file with the help of a llm".

### Option 1 - Make it
component 1: extract text from file (and ocr images) and create (text or vector) chunks
component 2: send chunks as context to a llm (maybe choose llm)


### Option 2 - Buy it
Upload a PDF file to openAI Api Assistant and then instruct assistant to ask questions about the file.
